Application of  Convolutional neural Network (ResNet) to detect the different brain tumors (Meningioma, Glioma, Pituitary)

# BrainTUmor Detector

BrainTumor Detectork is a complete brain tumor detection, classification, and diagnosis system with high accuracy (99.3%) that uses state of the art Deep Learning methods.

## Dataset

I have used [brain tumor dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427) posted by **Jun Cheng** on [figshare.com](figshare.com).

This brain tumor dataset containing 3064 T1-weighted contrast-inhanced images from 233 patients with three kinds of brain tumor: meningioma (708 slices), glioma (1426 slices), and pituitary tumor (930 slices).

## Modules

* [brain_tumor_dataset_preparation.ipynb](brain_tumor_dataset_preparation.ipynb) - An IPython notebook that contains preparation and preprocessing of dataset for training, validation and testing.

* [torch_brain_tumor_classifier.ipynb](torch_brain_tumor_classifier.ipynb) - An IPython notebook that contains all the steps, processes and results of training, validating and testing our brain tumor classifier.

* [test.py](test.py) - A python script which accepts path to an image as input, which then classifies the image into one of the three classes.


**Note:** We have included few images for testing under [test_images](test_images) directory.

## Running the classifier

Download the classifier model '.pt' file from this [drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-rIrzzqpsSg80QG175hjEPv9ilnSHmqK/view?usp=sharing) and place it under a folder named 'models' in the same directory where the files of this repository are present.

Before running the programs, kindly install the requirements as given in Requirements section of this README.

* Use the [test.py](test.py) script for running the script in Terminal, Powershell or Command Prompt.
  * `python test.py`

* Use [deploy.py](deploy.py) script to access the classifier as an interactive web interface.
  * `python deploy.py`

### Computational Specifications

Project done using Google Colab with follwing specifications:

* Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit OS
* 12 GB DDR4 RAM
* 16 GB NVidia Tesla P100 GPU
* 40 GB of Non-Persistent Storage

### Library Requirements

We'll be using the following libraries to complete our classification problem:

* **Numpy** - For linear algebra operations
* **Torch** - Pytorch Deep Learning Framework
* **OS** - To use Operating System methods
* **Random** - To set random seed at specific places where random operations take place just so it happens the same way everytime it is executed
* **Pandas** - To create DataFrame, CSV files, etc
* **Time** - To perform date time operations
* **Seaborn** - For sophisticated visualization
* **Pickle** - To save and load binary files of our training data
* **Scikit-Learn** - Machine learning framework. We have used this for evaluating our Classifier and for cross-validation split
* **Matplotlib** - To visualize images, losses and accuracy
* **Google Colab Drive** - To mount Google Drive so we can perform storage and loading operations using it (Only available on Google Colab)

The above mentioned libraries comes pre-installed and pre-configured with Google Colab.

Install the required libraries on your computer using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager.

For pip version 19.1 or above:

~~~bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
